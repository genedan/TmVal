   accumulation function
      A function that describes how much as single unit of currency grows over time. It is a special case of the amount function, where the amount invested is restricted to be one unit of currency.

   amount function
      A function that describes how much an invested amount of money grows over time.

   annual percentage rate (APR)
      The nominal interest rate.

   annual percentage yield (APY)
      The annual effective interest rate.

   compound interest
      A geometric pattern of money growth in which interest earned is reinvested at the rate of interest.

   discount
      The amount of money that must be paid up front on a loan.

   discount function
      The reciprocal of the accumulation function:

      .. math::

         v(t) = \frac{1}{a(t)}

   effective rate of interest
      A measurement of money growth equal to the percentage change in the value of an investment between two time periods:

      .. math::

         i_{[t_1, t_2]} = \frac{a(t_2) - a(t_1)}{a(t_1)}

   force of interest
      The limit of the nominal interest or discount rate as the compounding frequency approaches infinity.

   growth
      The change in the value of money over time.

   interest earned
      A measurement of money growth equal to the change in the value of an investment between two time periods:

      .. math::

         A_K(t_2) - A_K(t_1).

   net present value (NPV)
      The sum of the present value of a stream of returns:

      .. math::

         \sum_{k=0}^n R_k v(t_k)

   nominal interest rate
      the interest rate :math:`i^{(m)} compounded :math:`m` times per year. Money grows at a rate of:

      .. math::

         \left(1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m

   principal
      (1) An initial investment of money.
      (2) The original amount of a loan that must be paid back.

   nominal discount rate
      the discount rate :math:`d^{(m)} compounded :math:`m` times per year. Money grows at a rate of:

      .. math::

         \left(1 - \frac{(m)}{m}\right)^{-p}

   present value
      The value today of money to be received in the future.

   simple interest
      A linear pattern of money growth in which interest earned is a fixed amount per time period.

Installation and Quickstart
============================

TmVal can be installed from PyPI from the terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip3 install tvmal
   
TmVal can also be cloned from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/genedan/TmVal

If you are missing any dependencies, you can install them with the requirements.txt file located in the repo:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cd TmVal
   $ pip3 install requirements.txt

TmVal currently requires Python versions 3.6+. If the pip install command fails, you may need to install a newer version of Python.
